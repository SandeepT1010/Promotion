        <p>When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board it can turn into any piece but a king and pawn; queen, rook, bishop, knight.</p>
        <p>At the end of the game you might get into an endgame, which is when there are few pieces left on the board and usually the most important idea is to promote your pawn.</p>
        <p>You do not have to promote to a piece which you have already lost. For example, if you have a queen then you can promote to another queen.</p>
